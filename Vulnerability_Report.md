### Vulnerability Report

#### Summary of Issues:

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **File:** `routes.py`
   - **Line:** 31
   - **Issue:** SQL query constructed using string interpolation with user input
   - **CWE:** CWE-89: SQL Injection
   - **Recommendation:** Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection. Example fix:
     ```python
     query = text("SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = :username")
     result = db.session.execute(query, {'username': username})
     ```

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**
   - **File:** `templates/xss_result.html`
   - **Issue:** Use of `{{ username|safe }}` renders user input without escaping HTML special characters
   - **CWE:** CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
   - **Recommendation:** Avoid using the `safe` filter on user inputs unless they are properly sanitized. Use the default escaping mechanism provided by the template engine.

3. **Deprecated Library Usage**
   - **File:** `main.py`
   - **Line:** 5
   - **Issue:** Use of deprecated `psycopg2` version 2.7.7
   - **CWE:** CWE-937: Use of Deprecated Functionality
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade to a more recent version of `psycopg2` to ensure you receive security patches and improvements. Regularly audit your dependencies to avoid using deprecated or insecure libraries.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Location:** `routes.py`, Line 31
```python
query = text(f"SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '{username}'")
result = db.session.execute(query)
```
**Impact:** SQL injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data leaks, data corruption, or other malicious actions.

**Solution:** Use parameterized queries:
```python
query = text("SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = :username")
result = db.session.execute(query, {'username': username})
```

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
**Location:** `templates/xss_result.html`
```html
<p>Search term: {{ username|safe }}</p>
```
**Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Solution:** Remove the `safe` filter or properly sanitize user input.

#### Deprecated Library Usage
**Location:** `main.py`, Line 5
```python
import psycopg2
```
**Impact:** Deprecated libraries may contain unpatched vulnerabilities and can expose the application to security risks.

**Solution:** Upgrade to a supported version of `psycopg2` and regularly audit dependencies.

### Final Recommendations:
- **Implement Secure Coding Practices:** Ensure the use of secure coding practices, such as parameterized queries and avoiding hardcoded credentials.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of dependencies and update them to avoid deprecated or insecure libraries.
- **Sanitization and Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
- **Security Training:** Provide training for developers on secure coding practices and awareness of common vulnerabilities.
